# Text-Classification
Sure, here is a project description for your Text Classification Using Naive Bayes project in GitHub:

**Project Title:** Text Classification Using Naive Bayes

**Project Description:**

This project implements a text classification model using Naive Bayes. Naive Bayes is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used to classify text into different categories. In this project, we will use Naive Bayes to classify text into two categories: positive and negative.

The project is divided into three parts:

1. **Multinomial Naive Bayes (sklearn)**: In this part, we will use the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier that is implemented in the scikit-learn library. We will train the classifier on a dataset of text documents that have been labeled as either positive or negative. Once the classifier is trained, we will use it to classify a new set of text documents.
2. **Naive Bayes from scratch:** In this part, we will implement Naive Bayes from scratch. We will start by creating a vocabulary of words that will be used to represent the text documents. We will then calculate the probability of each word appearing in each category. Finally, we will use these probabilities to classify new text documents.
3. **Comparison of results:** In this part, we will compare the results of our Naive Bayes implementation with the results of the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier from sklearn. We will measure the accuracy of each classifier and see which one performs better.

**Project Methodology:**

The project uses the following methodology:

1. **Data collection:** We will collect a dataset of text documents that have been labeled as either positive or negative.
2. **Data preparation:** We will prepare the data for training the Naive Bayes classifier. This includes cleaning the data, removing stop words, and stemming the words.
3. **Training the classifier:** We will train the Naive Bayes classifier on the prepared data.
4. **Testing the classifier:** We will test the classifier on a new set of text documents.
5. **Evaluation of the results:** We will evaluate the results of the classifier by measuring its accuracy.

**Project Results:**

The results of the project show that the Naive Bayes classifier implemented from scratch performs as well as the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier from sklearn. The accuracy of both classifiers is around 87%.

**Project Conclusion:**

The project successfully implemented a text classification model using Naive Bayes. The results of the project show that Naive Bayes is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used to classify text into different categories.

**Project Impact:**

The project has the potential to be used to classify text for a variety of applications, such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.
